The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you don't fully understand operator precedence.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10px + 5px);` might not behave as you intend because addition and subtraction have equal precedence, and are evaluated from left to right. This can lead to a width that is smaller than expected.
